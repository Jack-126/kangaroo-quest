     "answer": "60", 
     "hint": "Carefully calculate both numerator and denominator. Remember, 2√ó0 is 0."},
    
    {"question": "The angles in a triangle are in the ratio 1:3:5. What is the biggest of those angles?", 
     "options": ["80¬∞", "90¬∞", "100¬∞", "110¬∞", "120¬∞"], 
     "answer": "100¬∞", 
     "hint": "The sum of angles in a triangle is 180¬∞. Use the ratio to split 180¬∞."},

     "answer": "606", 
     "hint": "There are 900 three-digit numbers in total (from 100 to 999). Instead of counting how many do have 1, 2, or 3, it's easier to count how many do not have any of them and subtract."},
